<h1>Version Control Software:</h1> Version control software, such as Git, allows developers to track and manage changes to their code over time. It helps teams collaborate, return to previous versions, and maintain a history of changes.

<h1>Add:</h1> In Git, the "add" command is used to stage changes in your working directory to be committed. It prepares the changes to be included in the next commit.

<h1>Commit:</h1> A commit in Git is a snapshot of the changes made to a repository. It is a way to save and record your changes with a message describing the modifications.

<h1>Push:</h1> Pushing in Git means uploading your local commits to a remote repository. It allows you to share your changes with others and make them available to the rest of the team.

<h1>Pull:</h1> Pulling in Git means fetching the latest changes from a remote repository and merging them into your local branch. It allows you to update your local repository with the latest changes made by others.

<h1>Clone:</h1> Cloning in Git means making a copy of a remote repository on your local machine. It downloads the entire repository, including all branches and commit history, allowing you to work on the project locally.
